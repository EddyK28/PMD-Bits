Miscellaneous things without a real home

 - Packerific.bat: A basic 3DS ROM (un)packing script for Windows
 - QR Codes.txt: Information about QR codes used for PSMD Rescue and Wonder Mail
 - Some AR Codes.txt: Like it says on the tin, some random PMD related AR codes
 - Text Directives - PSMD, GTI, RTDX.csv: all the text directive info from PSMD, GTI and RTDX
   - Empty cells means the directive doesn't exist in that game, + means "same as PSMD".  All descriptions are from PSMD.
   - Non-zero flags seems to mean the the number after the `:` is placed in the UTF char's least significant byte (eg `[S:3]` = `C403`).  Everything with the `:` needs some number after it.
